# TRAVEL APP PROJECT

## OVERVIEW

This is an online travel app where I worked with data sources from multiple apis to create a dynamic travel weather planning application that helps people plan trips by generating weather forecasts for the places they're visiting. It obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from three external APIs.

## TECHNOLOGY USED:

- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack
- Babel
- JavsScript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Application Programming Interface (API)

## SERVER SIDE CODE

The server file is under src/server/server.js

## CLIENT SIDE CODE

The client side files is under folder `src/client/`
APIs used include:

- [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
- [WeatherBit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)

## GETTING STARTED

Type in terminal `npm install` to install all the dependencies in the package.json

To start the app: run first `npm run build-prod`.

Then to start the server `run npm start`.

For test cases simply run `npm run test`.
